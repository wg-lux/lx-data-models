    abstract: Gastrointestinal endoscopy has proved to be a perfect context for the
      development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can aid endoscopists
      in many tasks of their daily activities. Lesion detection (computer-aided detection,
      CADe) and lesion characterization (computer-aided characterization, CADx) during
      colonoscopy are the clinical applications of AI in gastroenterology for which
      by far the most evidence has been published. Indeed, they are the only applications
      for which more than one system has been developed by different companies, is
      currently available on the market, and may be used in clinical practice. Both
      CADe and CADx, alongside hopes and hypes, come with potential drawbacks, limitations
      and dangers that must be known, studied and researched as much as the optimal
      uses of these machines, aiming to stay one step ahead of the possible misuse
      of what will always be an aid to the clinician and never a substitute. An AI
      revolution in colonoscopy is on the way, but the potential uses are infinite
      and only a fraction of them have currently been studied. Future applications
      can be designed to ensure all aspects of colonoscopy quality parameters and
      truly deliver a standardization of practice, regardless of the setting in which
      the procedure is performed. In this review, we cover the available clinical
      evidence on AI applications in colonoscopy and offer an overview of future directions.

    abstract: Background The efficiency of artificial intelligence as computer-aided
      detection (CADe) systems for colorectal polyps has been demonstrated in several
      randomized trials. However, CADe systems generate many distracting detections,
      especially during interventions such as polypectomies. Those distracting CADe
      detections are often induced by the introduction of snares or biopsy forceps
      as the systems have not been trained for such situations. In addition, there
      are a significant number of non-false but not relevant detections, since the
      polyp has already been previously detected. All these detections have the potential
      to disturb the examiner's work. Objectives Development and evaluation of a convolutional
      neuronal network that recognizes instruments in the endoscopic image, suppresses
      distracting CADe detections, and reliably detects endoscopic interventions.
      Methods A total of 580 different examination videos from 9 different centers
      using 4 different processor types were screened for instruments and represented
      the training dataset (519,856 images in total, 144,217 contained a visible instrument).
      The test dataset included 10 full-colonoscopy videos that were analyzed for
      the recognition of visible instruments and detections by a commercially available
      CADe system (GI Genius, Medtronic). Results The test dataset contained 153,623
      images, 8.84% of those presented visible instruments (12 interventions, 19 instruments
      used). The convolutional neuronal network reached an overall accuracy in the
      detection of visible instruments of 98.59%. Sensitivity and specificity were
      98.55% and 98.92%, respectively. A mean of 462.8 frames containing distracting

      Detection of endoscopic instruments in colonoscopy using artificial intelligence
      technology is reliable and achieves high sensitivity and specificity. Accordingly,
      the new convolutional neuronal network could be used to reduce distracting CADe

    description: Background The efficiency of artificial intelligence as computer-aided
      detection (CADe) systems for colorectal polyps has been demonstrated in several
      randomized trials. However, CADe systems generate many distracting detections,
      especially during interventions such as polypectomies. Those distracting CADe
      detections are often induced by the introduction of snares or biopsy forceps
      as the systems have not been trained for such situations. In addition, there
      are a significant number of non-false but not relevant detections, since the
      polyp has already been previously detected. All these detections have the potential
      to disturb the examiner's work. Objectives Development and evaluation of a convolutional
      neuronal network that recognizes instruments in the endoscopic image, suppresses
      distracting CADe detections, and reliably detects endoscopic interventions.
      Methods A total of 580 different examination videos from 9 different centers
      using 4 different processor types were screened for instruments and represented
      the training dataset (519,856 images in total, 144,217 contained a visible instrument).
      The test dataset included 10 full-colonoscopy videos that were analyzed for
      the recognition of visible instruments and detections by a commercially available
      CADe system (GI Genius, Medtronic). Results The test dataset contained 153,623
      images, 8.84% of those presented visible instruments (12 interventions, 19 instruments
      used). The convolutional neuronal network reached an overall accuracy in the
      detection of visible instruments of 98.59%. Sensitivity and specificity were
      98.55% and 98.92%, respectively. A mean of 462.8 frames containing distracting
      CADe detections per colonoscopy were avoided using the convolutional neuronal
      network. This accounted for 95.6% of all distracting CADe detections. Conclusions

      in English on the impact of screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy

      Results For screening sigmoidoscopy, four randomised controlled trials and 10
      observational studies were identified that consistently found a major reduction
      in distal but not proximal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Summary
      estimates of reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were
      31% (95% confidence intervals 26% to 37%) and 46% (33% to 57%) in intention
      to screen analysis, 42% (29% to 53%) and 61% (27% to 79%) in per protocol analysis
      of randomised controlled trials, and 64% (50% to 74%) and 66% (38% to 81%) in
      observational studies. For screening colonoscopy, evidence was restricted to
      six observational studies, the results of which suggest tentatively an even
      stronger reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, along
      with a significant reduction in mortality from cancer of the proximal colon.
      Indirect comparisons of results of observational studies on screening sigmoidoscopy
      and colonoscopy suggest a 40% to 60% lower risk of incident colorectal cancer
      and death from colorectal cancer after screening colonoscopy even though this
      incremental risk reduction was statistically significant for deaths from cancer
      of the proximal colon only.

      Conclusions Compelling and consistent evidence from randomised controlled trials
      and observational studies suggests that screening sigmoidoscopy and screening
      colonoscopy prevent most deaths from distal colorectal cancer. Observational
      studies suggest that colonoscopy compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy decreases
      mortality from cancer of the proximal colon. This added value should be examined

    abstract: "Introduction\nOptical diagnosis is necessary when selecting the resection\
      \ modality for large superficial colorectal lesions. The COlorectal NEoplasia\
      \ Endoscopic Classification to Choose the Treatment (CONECCT) encompasses overt\
      \ (irregular pit or vascular pattern) and covert (macroscopic features) signs\
      \ of carcinoma in an all\u2010in\u2010one classification using validated criteria.\
      \ The CONECCT IIC subtype corresponds to adenomas with a high risk of superficial\
      \ carcinoma that should be resected en bloc with free margins.\n\nMethods\n\
      This prospective multicentre study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the\
      \ CONECCT classification for predicting submucosal invasion in colorectal lesions\
      \ \\textgreater20\_mm. Optical diagnosis before en bloc resection by endoscopic\
      \ submucosal dissection (ESD) was compared with the final histological diagnosis.\
      \ Diagnostic accuracy for the CONECCT IIC subtype was compared with literature\u2010\
      validated features of concern considered to be risk factors for submucosal invasion\
      \ (non\u2010granular large spreading tumour [NG LST], macronodule \\textgreater1\_\
      cm, SANO IIIA area, and Paris 0\u2010IIC area).\n\nResults\nSix hundred 63 lesions\
      \ removed by ESD were assessed. The en bloc, R0, and curative resection rates\
      \ were respectively 96%, 85%, and 81%. The CONECCT classification had a sensitivity\
      \ (Se) of 100%, specificity (Sp) of 26.2%, positive predictive value of 11.6%,\
      \ and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% for predicting at least submucosal\
      \ adenocarcinoma. The sensitivity of CONECCT IIC (100%) to predict submucosal\
      \ cancer was superior to all other criteria evaluated. COlorectal NEoplasia\
      \ Endoscopic Classification to Choose the Treatment IIC lesions constituted\
      \ 11.5% of all submucosal carcinomas.\n\nConclusion\nThe CONECCT classification,\
      \ which combines covert and overt signs of carcinoma, identifies with very perfect\
      \ sensitivity (Se 100%, NPV 100%) the 30% of low\u2010risk adenomas in large\
      \ laterally spreading lesions treatable by piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection\
      \ or ESD according to expertise without undertreatment. However, the low specificity\
      \ of CONECCT leads to a large number of potentially not indicated ESDs for suspected\
      \ high\u2010risk lesions."

    description: "Introduction\nOptical diagnosis is necessary when selecting the\
      \ resection modality for large superficial colorectal lesions. The COlorectal\
      \ NEoplasia Endoscopic Classification to Choose the Treatment (CONECCT) encompasses\
      \ overt (irregular pit or vascular pattern) and covert (macroscopic features)\
      \ signs of carcinoma in an all\u2010in\u2010one classification using validated\
      \ criteria. The CONECCT IIC subtype corresponds to adenomas with a high risk\
      \ of superficial carcinoma that should be resected en bloc with free margins.\n\
      \nMethods\nThis prospective multicentre study investigated the diagnostic accuracy\
      \ of the CONECCT classification for predicting submucosal invasion in colorectal\
      \ lesions \\textgreater20\_mm. Optical diagnosis before en bloc resection by\
      \ endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was compared with the final histological\
      \ diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy for the CONECCT IIC subtype was compared with\
      \ literature\u2010validated features of concern considered to be risk factors\
      \ for submucosal invasion (non\u2010granular large spreading tumour [NG LST],\
      \ macronodule \\textgreater1\_cm, SANO IIIA area, and Paris 0\u2010IIC area).\n\
      \nResults\nSix hundred 63 lesions removed by ESD were assessed. The en bloc,\
      \ R0, and curative resection rates were respectively 96%, 85%, and 81%. The\
      \ CONECCT classification had a sensitivity (Se) of 100%, specificity (Sp) of\
      \ 26.2%, positive predictive value of 11.6%, and negative predictive value (NPV)\
      \ of 100% for predicting at least submucosal adenocarcinoma. The sensitivity\
      \ of CONECCT IIC (100%) to predict submucosal cancer was superior to all other\
      \ criteria evaluated. COlorectal NEoplasia Endoscopic Classification to Choose\
      \ the Treatment IIC lesions constituted 11.5% of all submucosal carcinomas.\n\
      \nConclusion\nThe CONECCT classification, which combines covert and overt signs\
      \ of carcinoma, identifies with very perfect sensitivity (Se 100%, NPV 100%)\
      \ the 30% of low\u2010risk adenomas in large laterally spreading lesions treatable\
      \ by piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection or ESD according to expertise without\
      \ undertreatment. However, the low specificity of CONECCT leads to a large number\
      \ of potentially not indicated ESDs for suspected high\u2010risk lesions."

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The proportion of screening colonoscopic examinations performed
      by a physician that detect one or more adenomas (the adenoma detection rate)
      is a recommended quality measure. However, little is known about the association
      between this rate and patients'' risks of a subsequent colorectal cancer (interval
      cancer) and death.

      METHODS: Using data from an integrated health care delivery organization, we
      evaluated the associations between the adenoma detection rate and the risks
      of colorectal cancer diagnosed 6 months to 10 years after colonoscopy and of
      cancer-related death. With the use of Cox regression, our estimates of attributable
      risk were adjusted for the demographic characteristics of the patients, indications
      for colonoscopy, and coexisting conditions.

      RESULTS: We evaluated 314,872 colonoscopies performed by 136 gastroenterologists;
      the adenoma detection rates ranged from 7.4 to 52.5%. During the follow-up period,
      we identified 712 interval colorectal adenocarcinomas, including 255 advanced-stage
      cancers, and 147 deaths from interval colorectal cancer. The unadjusted risks
      of interval cancer according to quintiles of adenoma detection rates, from lowest
      to highest, were 9.8, 8.6, 8.0, 7.0, and 4.8 cases per 10,000 person-years of
      follow-up, respectively. Among patients of physicians with adenoma detection
      rates in the highest quintile, as compared with patients of physicians with
      detection rates in the lowest quintile, the adjusted hazard ratio for any interval
      cancer was 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.69), for advanced-stage
      interval cancer, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.64), and for fatal interval cancer,
      0.38 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.65). Each 1.0% increase in the adenoma detection rate
      was associated with a 3.0% decrease in the risk of cancer (hazard ratio, 0.97;
      95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98).

      CONCLUSIONS: The adenoma detection rate was inversely associated with the risks
      of interval colorectal cancer, advanced-stage interval cancer, and fatal interval
      cancer. (Funded by the Kaiser Permanente Community Benefit program and the National

    abstract: Adhesion-type GPCRs (aGPCRs) participate in a vast range of physiological
      processes. Their frequent association with mechanosensitive functions suggests
      that processing of mechanical stimuli may be a common feature of this receptor
      family. Previously, we reported that the Drosophila aGPCR CIRL sensitizes sensory
      responses to gentle touch and sound by amplifying signal transduction in low-threshold
      mechanoreceptors (Scholz et al., 2017). Here, we show that Cirl is also expressed
      in high-threshold mechanical nociceptors where it adjusts nocifensive behaviour
      under physiological and pathological conditions. Optogenetic in vivo experiments
      indicate that CIRL lowers cAMP levels in both mechanosensory submodalities.
      However, contrasting its role in touch-sensitive neurons, CIRL dampens the response
      of nociceptors to mechanical stimulation. Consistent with this finding, rat
      nociceptors display decreased Cirl1 expression during allodynia. Thus, cAMP-downregulation
      by CIRL exerts opposing effects on low-threshold mechanosensors and high-threshold
      nociceptors. This intriguing bipolar action facilitates the separation of mechanosensory
      signals carrying different physiological information.

    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) has recently been proposed\

      \ Eligible average-risk subjects (45 years or older) undergoing screening or\

    abstract: "CLINICAL QUESTION: In adult patients undergoing colonoscopy for any\
      \ indication (screening, surveillance, follow-up of positive faecal immunochemical\
      \ testing, or gastrointestinal symptoms such as blood in the stools) what are\
      \ the benefits and harms of computer-aided detection (CADe)?\nCONTEXT AND CURRENT\
      \ PRACTICE: Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer and the second\
      \ leading cause of cancer-related death globally, typically arises from adenomatous\
      \ polyps. Detection and removal of polyps during colonoscopy can reduce the\
      \ risk of cancer. CADe systems use artificial intelligence (AI) to assist endoscopists\
      \ by analysing real-time colonoscopy images to detect potential polyps. Despite\
      \ their increasing use in clinical practice, guideline recommendations that\
      \ carefully balance all patient-important outcomes remain unavailable. In this\
      \ first iteration of a living guideline, we address the use of CADe at the level\
      \ of an individual patient.\nEVIDENCE: Evidence for this recommendation is drawn\
      \ from a living systematic review of 44 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\
      \ involving more than 30\u2009000 participants and a companion microsimulation\
      \ study simulating 10 year follow-up for 100\u2009000 individuals aged 60-69\
      \ years to assess the impact of CADe on patient-important outcomes. While no\
      \ direct evidence was found for critical outcomes of colorectal cancer incidence\
      \ and post-colonoscopy cancer incidence, low certainty data from the trials\
      \ indicate that CADe may increase positive endoscopy findings. The microsimulation\
      \ modelling, however, suggests little to no effect on CRC incidence, CRC-related\
      \ mortality, or colonoscopy-related complications (perforation and bleeding)\
      \ over the 10 year follow-up period, although low certainty evidence indicates\
      \ CADe may increase the number of colonoscopies performed per patient. A review\
      \ of values and preferences identified that patients value mortality reduction\
      \ and quality of care but worry about increased anxiety, overdiagnosis, and\
      \ more frequent surveillance.\nRECOMMENDATION: For adults who have agreed to\
      \ undergo colonoscopy, we suggest against the routine use of CADe (weak recommendation).\n\
      HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: An international panel, including three patient\
      \ partners, 11 healthcare providers, and seven methodologists, deemed by MAGIC\
      \ and The BMJ to have no relevant competing interests, developed this recommendation.\
      \ For this guideline the panel took an individual patient approach. The panel\
      \ started by defining the clinical question in PICO format, and prioritised\
      \ outcomes including CRC incidence and mortality. Based on the linked systematic\
      \ review and microsimulation study, the panel sought to balance the benefits,\
      \ harms, and burdens of CADe and assumed patient preferences when making this\
      \ recommendation UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: The guideline panel found\
      \ the benefits of CADe on critical outcomes, such as CRC incidence and post-colonoscopy\
      \ cancer incidence, over a 10 year follow up period to be highly uncertain.\
      \ Low certainty evidence suggests little to no impact on CRC-related mortality,\
      \ while the potential burdens-including more frequent surveillance colonoscopies-are\
      \ likely to affect many patients. Given the small and uncertain benefits and\
      \ the likelihood of burdens, the panel issued a weak recommendation against\
      \ routine CADe use.The panel acknowledges the anticipated variability in values\
      \ and preferences among patients and clinicians when considering these uncertain\
      \ benefits and potential burdens. In healthcare settings where CADe is available,\
      \ individual decision making may be appropriate.\nUPDATES: This is the first\
      \ iteration of a living practice guideline. The panel will update this living\
      \ guideline if ongoing evidence surveillance identifies new CADe trial data\
      \ that substantially alters our conclusions about CRC incidence, mortality,\
      \ or burdens, or studies that increase our certainty in values and preferences\
      \ of individual patients. Updates will provide recommendations on the use of\
      \ CADe from a healthcare systems perspective (including resource use, acceptability,\
      \ feasibility, and equity), as well as the combined use of CADe and computer\
      \ aided diagnosis (CADx). Users can access the latest guideline version and\

      may still require agreement from multiple, sometimes ideologically opposed parties.
      Despite their prominence and influence on key decisions, consensus methods are

      a systematic review was followed by a Delphi process and meetings to finalize
      the ACCORD checklist. The preliminary checklist was drawn from the systematic
      review of existing literature on the quality of reporting of consensus methods
      and suggestions from the Steering Committee. A Delphi panel (n = 72) was recruited
      with representation from 6 continents and a broad range of experience, including
      clinical, research, policy, and patient perspectives. The 3 rounds of the Delphi
      process were completed by 58, 54, and 51 panelists. The preliminary checklist

      the first reporting guideline applicable to all consensus-based studies. It
      will support authors in writing accurate, detailed manuscripts, thereby improving
      the completeness and transparency of reporting and providing readers with clarity
      regarding the methods used to reach agreement. Furthermore, the checklist will
      make the rigor of the consensus methods used to guide the recommendations clear

      regarding the methods used to reach agreement. Furthermore, the checklist will
      make the rigor of the consensus methods used to guide the recommendations clear
      for readers. Reporting consensus studies with greater clarity and transparency
      may enhance trust in the recommendations made by consensus panels.'

      \ study.\n\nSetting\nCost effectiveness working package in the OperA (optimising\
      \ colorectal cancer prevention through personalised treatment with artificial\
      \ intelligence) project. A parallel guideline committee panel (BMJ Rapid recommendation)\
      \ was consulted in defining the screening interventions and selection of outcome\
      \ measures.\n\nPopulation\nFour cohorts of 100\u2009000 European individuals\
      \ aged 60-69 years.\n\nIntervention\nThe intervention was one screening of colonoscopy\
      \ and a screening of colonoscopy after faecal immunochemical test every other\
      \ year with CADe. The comparison group had the same screening every other year\
      \ without CADe.\n\nMain outcome measures\nBenefits (colorectal cancer incidence\
      \ and death), burden (surveillance colonoscopies), and harms (colonoscopy related\
      \ adverse events) over 10\u2009years were measured. The certainty in each outcome\
      \ was assessed by use of the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,\
      \ and Evaluation) approach.\n\nResults\nFor 100\u2009000 individuals participating\
      \ in colonoscopy screening, 824 (0.82%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer\
      \ within 10 years without CADe versus 713 (0.71%) with CADe (risk difference\

      The aim of this study was to clarify whether adenoma miss rate (AMR) could be
      reduced with CADe assistance during screening and surveillance colonoscopy.

      or polyps) and cecal intubation are recommended for use as quality indicators
      for screening colonoscopy, these measurements have not been validated, and their
      importance remains uncertain.

      METHODS: We used a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model to
      evaluate the influence of quality indicators for colonoscopy on the risk of
      interval cancer. Data were collected from 186 endoscopists who were involved
      in a colonoscopy-based colorectal-cancer screening program involving 45,026
      subjects. Interval cancer was defined as colorectal adenocarcinoma that was
      diagnosed between the time of screening colonoscopy and the scheduled time of
      surveillance colonoscopy. We derived data on quality indicators for colonoscopy
      from the screening program''s database and data on interval cancers from cancer
      registries. The primary aim of the study was to assess the association between
      quality indicators for colonoscopy and the risk of interval cancer.

      RESULTS: A total of 42 interval colorectal cancers were identified during a
      period of 188,788 person-years. The endoscopist''s rate of detection of adenomas
      was significantly associated with the risk of interval colorectal cancer (P=0.008),
      whereas the rate of cecal intubation was not significantly associated with this
      risk (P=0.50). The hazard ratios for adenoma detection rates of less than 11.0%,
      11.0 to 14.9%, and 15.0 to 19.9%, as compared with a rate of 20.0% or higher,
      were 10.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 87.01), 10.75 (95% CI, 1.36
      to 85.06), and 12.50 (95% CI, 1.51 to 103.43), respectively (P=0.02 for all
      comparisons).

      CONCLUSIONS: The adenoma detection rate is an independent predictor of the risk
      of interval colorectal cancer after screening colonoscopy.'

    abstract: 'Background

      Magnifying Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) during colonoscopy is a reliable method
      for differential and depth diagnoses of colorectal lesions. This study examined
      the diagnostic yield of magnifying NBI based on the Japan NBI Expert Team (JNET)
      classification in a clinical setting using a large-scale clinical practice database.
      Types 1, 2A, 2B and 3 correspond to the histopathological classifications of
      hyperplastic polyp/sessile-serrated polyp, low-grade intramucosal neoplasia,
      high-grade intramucosal neoplasia/shallow submucosal invasive cancer, and deep
      submucosal invasive cancer, respectively.


      Methods

      The prospective records of colonoscopy reports and pathological data of 1558
      consecutive superficial colorectal lesions removed by colonoscopy were retrospectively
      analysed. After excluding 156 lesions, the documented JNET classifications of
      the remaining 1402 colorectal lesions were analysed. Diagnostic yield was analysed
      and also compared between expert endoscopists and nonexpert endoscopists.


      Results

      The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive
      value (NPV) and accuracy were respectively 75%, 96%, 74%, 96% and 93% for type
      1; 91%, 70%, 92%, 67% and 87% for type 2A; 42%, 95%, 26%, 98% and 93% for type
      2B; and 35%, 100%, 93%, 98% and 98% for type 3. Nonexpert and expert endoscopists
      alike had specificity, NPV and accuracy \textgreater90% for types 1, 2B and
      3, and a sensitivity and PPV \textgreater90% for type 2A. Type 2B had a low
      sensitivity of 42% because it included various histological features.


      Conclusions

      The JNET classification proved useful in a clinical setting both for expert
      and nonexpert endoscopists, as was expected from the original JNET definition,
      but type 2B requires further investigation using pit pattern diagnosis.'

    abstract: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased dramatically
      in the last 20 years, with clinical applications progressively being explored
      for most of the medical specialties. The field of gastroenterology and hepatology,
      substantially reliant on vast amounts of imaging studies, is not an exception.
      The clinical applications of AI systems in this field include the identification
      of premalignant or malignant lesions (e.g., identification of dysplasia or esophageal
      adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, pancreatic malignancies), detection of
      lesions (e.g., polyp identification and classification, small-bowel bleeding
      lesion on capsule endoscopy, pancreatic cystic lesions), development of objective
      scoring systems for risk stratification, predicting disease prognosis or treatment
      response [e.g., determining survival in patients post-resection of hepatocellular
      carcinoma), determining which patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      will benefit from biologic therapy], or evaluation of metrics such as bowel
      preparation score or quality of endoscopic examination. The objective of this
      comprehensive review is to analyze the available AI-related studies pertaining
      to the entirety of the gastrointestinal tract, including the upper, middle and
      lower tracts; IBD; the hepatobiliary system; and the pancreas, discussing the

    abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The 6-minute withdrawal time for colonoscopy,\
      \ widely considered the standard of care, is controversial. The skill and technique\
      \ of endoscopists may be as important as, or more important than, withdrawal\
      \ time for adenoma detection. It is unclear whether a shorter withdrawal time\
      \ with good technique yields an acceptable lesion detection rate. Our objective\
      \ was to evaluate a 3-minute versus a 6-minute withdrawal time by using segmental\
      \ tandem colonoscopy.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized trial\
      \ by using 4 expert endoscopists. Patients were randomized to a 3-minute or\
      \ a 6-minute initial withdrawal, each followed by a tandem second 6-minute withdrawal.\
      \ All polyps were removed. The primary outcomes were adenoma miss rates (AMRs),\
      \ adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) rates, and adenoma detection rates (ADRs).\n\
      RESULTS: A total of 99 and 101 patients were enrolled in the 3-minute and 6-minute\
      \ withdrawal groups, respectively. The AMR was significantly higher in the 3-minute\
      \ withdrawal group (48.0% vs 22.9%; P\_= .0001). After controlling for endoscopist,\
      \ patient age and/or sex, Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score, and size and/or\

      \ in the 3-minute withdrawal group (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval,\
      \ 1.35-5.15; P\_= .0001). The ADR was similar between both groups (39.2% vs\

      \ 3-minute withdrawal group (0.55 vs 0.80; P\_= .0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The AMR\

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The effect of computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) on
      adenoma detection rate (ADR) among endoscopists-in-training remains unknown.

      METHODS: We performed a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled
      trial in Hong Kong between April 2021 and July 2022 (NCT04838951). Eligible
      subjects undergoing screening/surveillance/diagnostic colonoscopies were randomized
      1:1 to receive colonoscopies with CADe (ENDO-AID[OIP-1]) or not (control) during
      withdrawal. Procedures were performed by endoscopists-in-training with \textless500
      procedures and \textless3 years'' experience. Randomization was stratified by
      patient age, sex, and endoscopist experience (beginner vs intermediate level,
      \textless200 vs 200-500 procedures). Image enhancement and distal attachment
      devices were disallowed. Subjects with incomplete colonoscopies or inadequate
      bowel preparation were excluded. Treatment allocation was blinded to outcome
      assessors. The primary outcome was ADR. Secondary outcomes were ADR for different
      adenoma sizes and locations, mean number of adenomas, and non-neoplastic resection
      rate.

      RESULTS: A total of 386 and 380 subjects were randomized to CADe and control
      groups, respectively. The overall ADR was significantly higher in the CADe group
      than in the control group (57.5% vs 44.5%; adjusted relative risk, 1.41; 95%
      CI, 1.17-1.72; P \textless .001). The ADRs for \textless5 mm (40.4% vs 25.0%)
      and 5- to 10-mm adenomas (36.8% vs 29.2%) were higher in the CADe group. The
      ADRs were higher in the CADe group in both the right colon (42.0% vs 30.8%)
      and left colon (34.5% vs 27.6%), but there was no significant difference in
      advanced ADR. The ADRs were higher in the CADe group among beginner (60.0% vs
      41.9%) and intermediate-level (56.5% vs 45.5%) endoscopists. Mean number of
      adenomas (1.48 vs 0.86) and non-neoplastic resection rate (52.1% vs 35.0%) were
      higher in the CADe group.

      CONCLUSIONS: Among endoscopists-in-training, the use of CADe during colonoscopies
      was associated with increased overall ADR. (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT04838951).'

      voice alarm, so as to compare the detection rate of polyp.

      Results: Compared with group CON, the detection rate of adenomas increased in
      group CADe, the average number of adenomas increased, the number of small adenomas
      increased, the number of proliferative polyps increased, and the differences
      were statistically significant (P \textless 0.001), but the comparison for the
      number of larger adenomas showed no significant difference between the groups
      (P\textgreater 0.05).

      Conclusions: The CADe system is feasible for increasing the detection of polyps
      and adenomas in colonoscopy.'

    abstract: 'Introduction: Comprehensive and standardized colonoscopy reports are
      crucial in colorectal cancer prevention, monitoring, and research. This study
      investigates adherence to national and international guidelines by analyzing
      reporting practices among 21 endoscopists in 7 German centers, with a focus
      on polyp reporting. Methods: We identified and assessed German, European, American,
      and World Health Organization-provided statements to identify key elements in
      colonoscopy reporting. Board-certified gastroenterologists rated the relevance
      of each element and estimated their reporting frequency. Adherence to the identified
      report elements was evaluated for 874 polyps from 351 colonoscopy reports ranging
      from March 2021 to March 2022. Results: We identified numerous recommendations
      for colonoscopy reporting. We categorized the reasoning behind those recommendations
      into clinical relevance, justification, and quality control and research. Although
      all elements were considered relevant by the surveyed gastroenterologists, discrepancies
      were observed in the evaluated reports. Particularly diminutive polyps or attributes
      which are rarely abnormal (e.g., surface integrity) respectively rarely performed
      (e.g., injection) were sparsely documented. Furthermore, the white light morphology
      of polyps was inconsistently documented using either the Paris classification
      or free text. In summary, the analysis of 874 reported polyps revealed heterogeneous
      adherence to the recommendations, with reporting frequencies ranging from 3%
      to 89%. Conclusion: The inhomogeneous report practices may result from implicit
      reporting practices and recommendations with varying clinical relevance. Future
      recommendations should clearly differentiate between clinical relevance and
      research and quality control or explanatory purposes. Additionally, the role
      of computer-assisted documentation should be further evaluated to increase report
      frequencies of non-pathological findings and diminutive polyps.'

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted polyp detection
      systems for colonoscopic use are currently attracting attention because they
      may reduce the possibility of missed adenomas. However, few systems have the
      necessary regulatory approval for use in clinical practice. We aimed to develop
      an AI-assisted polyp detection system and to validate its performance using
      a large colonoscopy video database designed to be publicly accessible.

      METHODS: To develop the deep learning-based AI system, 56,668 independent colonoscopy
      images were obtained from 5 centers for use as training images. To validate
      the trained AI system, consecutive colonoscopy videos taken at a university
      hospital between October 2018 and January 2019 were searched to construct a
      database containing polyps with unbiased variance. All images were annotated
      by endoscopists according to the presence or absence of polyps and the polyps''
      locations with bounding boxes.

      RESULTS: A total of 1405 videos acquired during the study period were identified
      for the validation database, 797 of which contained at least 1 polyp. Of these,
      100 videos containing 100 independent polyps and 13 videos negative for polyps
      were randomly extracted, resulting in 152,560 frames (49,799 positive frames
      and 102,761 negative frames) for the database. The AI showed 90.5% sensitivity

    description: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted polyp
      detection systems for colonoscopic use are currently attracting attention because
      they may reduce the possibility of missed adenomas. However, few systems have
      the necessary regulatory approval for use in clinical practice. We aimed to
      develop an AI-assisted polyp detection system and to validate its performance
      using a large colonoscopy video database designed to be publicly accessible.

      METHODS: To develop the deep learning-based AI system, 56,668 independent colonoscopy
      images were obtained from 5 centers for use as training images. To validate
      the trained AI system, consecutive colonoscopy videos taken at a university
      hospital between October 2018 and January 2019 were searched to construct a
      database containing polyps with unbiased variance. All images were annotated
      by endoscopists according to the presence or absence of polyps and the polyps''
      locations with bounding boxes.

      RESULTS: A total of 1405 videos acquired during the study period were identified
      for the validation database, 797 of which contained at least 1 polyp. Of these,
      100 videos containing 100 independent polyps and 13 videos negative for polyps
      were randomly extracted, resulting in 152,560 frames (49,799 positive frames
      and 102,761 negative frames) for the database. The AI showed 90.5% sensitivity
      and 93.7% specificity for frame-based analysis. The per-polyp sensitivities
      for all, diminutive, protruded, and flat polyps were 98.0%, 98.3%, 98.5%, and
      97.0%, respectively.

      CONCLUSIONS: Our trained AI system was validated with a new large publicly accessible
      colonoscopy database and could identify colorectal lesions with high sensitivity
      and specificity. (Clinical trial registration number: UMIN 000037064.).'

    abstract: Background Previous studies have shown colonoscopy withdrawal time (WT)
      to be a reliable surrogate indicator for polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenoma
      detection rate (ADR) in colonoscopy. Our aim was to assess the impact of feedback
      and monitoring of WT on PDR in routine colonoscopies with long-term follow-up.Materials
      and methods A total of 307 colonoscopies were performed in three separate clinical
      scenarios. First, PDR and WT were recorded without the staff being aware of
      the specific objective of the study. Before the second scenario, the staff was
      given interventional information and feedback on WTs and PDRs from the first
      scenario and was encouraged to aim for a minimum WT of 8 min. Retention of knowledge
      gained was reassessed in the third scenario 1 year later.Results The PDR in
      the first two scenarios differed significantly (p\textless0.01), with a more
      than 90% increase in PDR after intervention from 22% to 42% (95% CI 1.44 to
      4.95), although the mean WT did not change (6.8 vs 7.2 min; p\textgreater0.05).
      The increase in PDR between the first and second scenarios was retained in the
      third follow-up scenario 1 year later where the WT of both polyp-positive and
      polyp-negative colonoscopies was found to be longer.Conclusions PDR almost doubled
      from the first to the second scenario of a real-life colonoscopy setting, indicating
      that awareness of WT is crucial. The knowledge gained from this intervention
      in routine practice was even retained after a year.

    abstract: Most colorectal tumors larger than 20 mm in diameter are called laterally
      spreading tumors (LST), most of which are adenomatous lesions. Laterally spreading
      tumors are classified into two types according to their morphology, granular
      type (LST-G) and non-granular type (LST-NG). Each type has two subtypes. The
      former consists of a 'homogenous type' and a 'nodular mixed type', while the
      latter consists of a 'flat elevated (FE) type' and a 'psedodepressed (PD) type'.
      In LST-G and LST-NG FE types, type V pit pattern with magnification enables
      the recognition of the carcinomatous or submucosal invasive area. Most of these
      adenomatous large lesions can be cured by scheduled endoscopic piecemeal mucosal
      resection (EPMR). However, LST-G with large whole nodular type or type V pit
      pattern, which cannot be resected en bloc with a snare, is an indication for
      endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The LST-NG PD has a high frequency of
      submucosal invasion and the submucosal invasive area cannot be recognized correctly
      in the pseudodepression with magnification prior to endoscopic treatment. Therefore,
      en bloc resection with ESD should be applied to LST-NG PD. The therapeutic strategy
      for choosing between EPMR and ESD for large LST lesions should therefore be
      determined based on the macroscopic findings of their subtype and pit pattern
      findings.

    abstract: 'Peripheral neuropathy is accompanied by changes in the neuronal environment.
      The blood-nerve barrier (BNB) is crucial in protecting the neural homeostasis:
      Tight junctions (TJ) seal paracellular spaces and thus prevent external stimuli
      from entering. In different models of neuropathic pain, the BNB is impaired,
      thus contributing to local damage, immune cells invasion and, ultimately, the
      development of neuropathy with its symptoms. In this study, we examined changes
      in expression and microstructural localization of two key tight junction proteins
      (TJP), claudin-1 and the cytoplasmic anchoring ZO-1, in the sciatic nerve of
      mice subjected to chronic constriction injury (CCI). Via qPCR and analysis of
      fluorescence immunohistochemistry, a marked downregulation of mRNA as well as
      decreased fluorescence intensity were observed in the nerve for both proteins.
      Moreover, a distinct zig-zag structure for both proteins located at cell-cell
      contacts, indicative of the localization of TJs, was observed in the perineurial
      compartment of sham-operated animals. This microstructural location in cell-cell-contacts
      was lost in neuropathy as semiquantified via computational analysis, based on
      a novel algorithm. In summary, we provide evidence that peripheral neuropathy
      is not only associated with decrease in relevant TJPs but also exhibits alterations
      in TJP arrangement and loss in barrier tightness, presumably due to internalization.
      Specifically, semiquantification of TJP in cell-cell-contacts of microcompartments
      could be used in the future for routine clinical samples of patients with neuropathy.'

    abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: One-fourth of colorectal neoplasias are missed during\
      \ screening colonoscopies; these can develop into colorectal cancer (CRC). Deep\
      \ learning systems allow for real-time computer-aided detection (CADe) of polyps\
      \ with high accuracy. We performed a multicenter, randomized trial to assess\
      \ the safety and efficacy of a CADe system in detection of colorectal neoplasias\
      \ during real-time colonoscopy.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from 685 subjects\
      \ (61.32 \xB1 10.2 years old; 337 men) undergoing screening colonoscopies for\
      \ CRC, post-polypectomy surveillance, or workup due to positive results from\
      \ a fecal immunochemical test or signs or symptoms of CRC, at 3 centers in Italy\
      \ from September through November 2019. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1)\
      \ to groups who underwent high-definition colonoscopies with the CADe system\
      \ or without (controls). The CADe system included an artificial intelligence-based\
      \ medical device (GI-Genius, Medtronic) trained to process colonoscopy images\
      \ and superimpose them, in real time, on the endoscopy display a green box over\
      \ suspected lesions. A minimum withdrawal time of 6 minutes was required. Lesions\
      \ were collected and histopathology findings were used as the reference standard.\
      \ The primary outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR, the percentage of patients\
      \ with at least 1 histologically proven adenoma or carcinoma). Secondary outcomes\
      \ were adenomas detected per colonoscopy, non-neoplastic resection rate, and\
      \ withdrawal time.\nRESULTS: The ADR was significantly higher in the CADe group\
      \ (54.8%) than in the control group (40.4%) (relative risk [RR], 1.30; 95% confidence\
      \ interval [CI], 1.14-1.45). Adenomas detected per colonoscopy were significantly\
      \ higher in the CADe group (mean, 1.07 \xB11.54) than in the control group (mean\
      \ 0.71 \xB1 1.20) (incidence rate ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.15-1.86). Adenomas\
      \ 5 mm or smaller were detected in a significantly higher proportion of subjects\
      \ in the CADe group (33.7%) than in the control group (26.5%; RR, 1.26; 95%\
      \ CI, 1.01-1.52), as were adenomas of 6 to 9 mm (detected in 10.6% of subjects\
      \ in the CADe group vs 5.8% in the control group; RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.09-2.86),\
      \ regardless of morphology or location. There was no significant difference\
      \ between groups in withdrawal time (417 \xB1 101 seconds for the CADe group\
      \ vs 435 \xB1 149 for controls; P\_= .1) or proportion of subjects with resection\
      \ of non-neoplastic lesions (26.0% in the CADe group vs 28.7% of controls; RR,\
      \ 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90-1.12).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter, randomized trial,\
      \ we found that including CADe in real-time colonoscopy significantly increases\
      \ ADR and adenomas detected per colonoscopy without increasing withdrawal time.\

      \ during screening colonoscopies; these can develop into colorectal cancer (CRC).\
      \ Deep learning systems allow for real-time computer-aided detection (CADe)\
      \ of polyps with high accuracy. We performed a multicenter, randomized trial\
      \ to assess the safety and efficacy of a CADe system in detection of colorectal\
      \ neoplasias during real-time colonoscopy.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from 685\
      \ subjects (61.32 \xB1 10.2 years old; 337 men) undergoing screening colonoscopies\
      \ for CRC, post-polypectomy surveillance, or workup due to positive results\
      \ from a fecal immunochemical test or signs or symptoms of CRC, at 3 centers\
      \ in Italy from September through November 2019. Patients were randomly assigned\
      \ (1:1) to groups who underwent high-definition colonoscopies with the CADe\
      \ system or without (controls). The CADe system included an artificial intelligence-based\
      \ medical device (GI-Genius, Medtronic) trained to process colonoscopy images\
      \ and superimpose them, in real time, on the endoscopy display a green box over\
      \ suspected lesions. A minimum withdrawal time of 6 minutes was required. Lesions\
      \ were collected and histopathology findings were used as the reference standard.\
      \ The primary outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR, the percentage of patients\
      \ with at least 1 histologically proven adenoma or carcinoma). Secondary outcomes\
      \ were adenomas detected per colonoscopy, non-neoplastic resection rate, and\
      \ withdrawal time.\nRESULTS: The ADR was significantly higher in the CADe group\
      \ (54.8%) than in the control group (40.4%) (relative risk [RR], 1.30; 95% confidence\
      \ interval [CI], 1.14-1.45). Adenomas detected per colonoscopy were significantly\
      \ higher in the CADe group (mean, 1.07 \xB11.54) than in the control group (mean\
      \ 0.71 \xB1 1.20) (incidence rate ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.15-1.86). Adenomas\
      \ 5 mm or smaller were detected in a significantly higher proportion of subjects\
      \ in the CADe group (33.7%) than in the control group (26.5%; RR, 1.26; 95%\
      \ CI, 1.01-1.52), as were adenomas of 6 to 9 mm (detected in 10.6% of subjects\
      \ in the CADe group vs 5.8% in the control group; RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.09-2.86),\
      \ regardless of morphology or location. There was no significant difference\
      \ between groups in withdrawal time (417 \xB1 101 seconds for the CADe group\
      \ vs 435 \xB1 149 for controls; P\_= .1) or proportion of subjects with resection\
      \ of non-neoplastic lesions (26.0% in the CADe group vs 28.7% of controls; RR,\
      \ 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90-1.12).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter, randomized trial,\
      \ we found that including CADe in real-time colonoscopy significantly increases\
      \ ADR and adenomas detected per colonoscopy without increasing withdrawal time.\

      We conducted a comprehensive literature search to include studies through October

      recommendations on the role of aspirin for chemoprevention, quality indicators
      for colonoscopy, approaches to organized CRC screening and improving adherence
      to CRC screening. CRC screening must be optimized to allow effective and sustained
      reduction of CRC incidence and mortality. This can be accomplished by achieving
      high rates of adherence, quality monitoring and improvement, following evidence-based
      guidelines, and removing barriers through the spectrum of care from noninvasive

      \ Google Scholar, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science\
      \ Core Collection databases were searched through February 2024.Study Selection:Published\
      \ RCTs comparing CADe-enhanced and conventional colonoscopy.Data Extraction:Average\
      \ adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) and ACN per colonoscopy were primary outcomes.\
      \ Adenoma detection rate, AMR, and ACN detection rate (ACN DR) were secondary\
      \ outcomes. Balancing outcomes included withdrawal time and resection of nonneoplastic\
      \ polyps (NNPs). Subgroup analyses were done by neural network architecture.Data\
      \ Synthesis:Forty-four RCTs with 36\u2009201 cases were included. Computer-aided\
      \ detection\u2013enhanced colonoscopies have higher average APC (12\u2009090\
      \ of 12\u2009279 [0.98] vs. 9690 of 12\u2009292 [0.78], incidence rate difference\

      \ vs. 5825 of 15\u2009855 [36.7%], rate ratio [RR] = 1.21 [CI, 1.15 to 1.28]).\
      \ Average ACN per colonoscopy was similar (1512 of 9296 [0.16] vs. 1392 of 9121\
      \ [0.15], IRD = 0.01 [CI, \u22120.01 to 0.02]), but ACN DR was higher with CADe\

      \ 1.02 to 1.32]). Using CADe systems resulted in resection of almost 2 extra\
      \ NNPs per 10 colonoscopies and longer total withdrawal time (0.53 minutes [CI,\
      \ 0.30 to 0.77]).Limitation:Statistically significant heterogeneity in quality\

      \ is unclear.Purpose:To conduct a systematic review to compare performance of\
      \ CADe-enhanced and conventional colonoscopy.Data Sources:Cochrane Library,\
      \ Google Scholar, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science\
      \ Core Collection databases were searched through February 2024.Study Selection:Published\
      \ RCTs comparing CADe-enhanced and conventional colonoscopy.Data Extraction:Average\
      \ adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) and ACN per colonoscopy were primary outcomes.\
      \ Adenoma detection rate, AMR, and ACN detection rate (ACN DR) were secondary\
      \ outcomes. Balancing outcomes included withdrawal time and resection of nonneoplastic\
      \ polyps (NNPs). Subgroup analyses were done by neural network architecture.Data\
      \ Synthesis:Forty-four RCTs with 36\u2009201 cases were included. Computer-aided\
      \ detection\u2013enhanced colonoscopies have higher average APC (12\u2009090\
      \ of 12\u2009279 [0.98] vs. 9690 of 12\u2009292 [0.78], incidence rate difference\
      \ [IRD] = 0.22 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.28]) and higher ADR (7098 of 16\u2009253 [44.7%]\
      \ vs. 5825 of 15\u2009855 [36.7%], rate ratio [RR] = 1.21 [CI, 1.15 to 1.28]).\
      \ Average ACN per colonoscopy was similar (1512 of 9296 [0.16] vs. 1392 of 9121\
      \ [0.15], IRD = 0.01 [CI, \u22120.01 to 0.02]), but ACN DR was higher with CADe\
      \ system use (1260 of 9899 [12.7%] vs. 1119 of 9746 [11.5%], RR = 1.16 [CI,\
      \ 1.02 to 1.32]). Using CADe systems resulted in resection of almost 2 extra\
      \ NNPs per 10 colonoscopies and longer total withdrawal time (0.53 minutes [CI,\
      \ 0.30 to 0.77]).Limitation:Statistically significant heterogeneity in quality\
      \ and sample size and inability to blind endoscopists to the intervention in\
      \ included studies may affect the performance estimates.Conclusion:Computer-aided\
      \ detection\u2013enhanced colonoscopies have increased APC and detection rate\
      \ but no difference in ACN per colonoscopy and a small increase in ACN DR. There\
      \ is minimal increase in procedure time and no difference in performance across\
      \ neural network architectures.Primary Funding Source:None. (PROSPERO: CRD42023422835)"

      was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries
      for both sexes, whereas mortality varied \textless2-fold for men and little

      considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs
      12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer
      burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with
      a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to
      56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated
      by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy.
      Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer
      prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Artificial intelligence based computer-aided
      polyp detection (CADe) systems receive regular updates and occasionally offer
      customizable detection thresholds which impact their performance, but little
      is known about these effects. This study aimed to compare the performance of
      different CADe systems on the same benchmark dataset.

      METHODS: 101 colonoscopy videos were used as benchmark. Each video frame with
      a visible polyp was manually annotated with bounding boxes resulting in 129,705
      polyp images. The videos were then analyzed by three different CADe systems:
      two versions of GI-Genius, two detection types of EndoAID and the freely-available
      system EndoMind. The evaluation included an extensive analysis of sensitivity
      and false-positive rate, among others.

      RESULTS: EndoAID (Type A), the earlier version of GI-Genius and EndoMind detected
      all 93 polyps. Both the later version of GI-Genius and EndoAID (Type B) missed
      one polyp. The mean per-frame sensitivity was of 50.63% and 67.85% for the earlier
      and the latest version of GI-Genius, 65.60% and 52.95% for EndoAID (Type A and
      B), and 60.22% for EndoMind.

      CONCLUSIONS: This study compares the performance of different CADe systems,

      to select the most appropriate system for their specific needs.'

    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The effect of colonoscopy on colorectal cancer mortality
      is limited by several factors, among them a certain miss rate, leading to limited
      adenoma detection rates (ADRs). We investigated the effect of an automatic polyp
      detection system based on deep learning on polyp detection rate and ADR.

      DESIGN: In an open, non-blinded trial, consecutive patients were prospectively
      randomised to undergo diagnostic colonoscopy with or without assistance of a
      real-time automatic polyp detection system providing a simultaneous visual notice
      and sound alarm on polyp detection. The primary outcome was ADR.

      RESULTS: Of 1058 patients included, 536 were randomised to standard colonoscopy,
      and 522 were randomised to colonoscopy with computer-aided diagnosis. The artificial
      intelligence (AI) system significantly increased ADR (29.1%vs20.3%, p\textless0.001)
      and the mean number of adenomas per patient (0.53vs0.31, p\textless0.001). This
      was due to a higher number of diminutive adenomas found (185vs102; p\textless0.001),
      while there was no statistical difference in larger adenomas (77vs58, p=0.075).
      In addition, the number of hyperplastic polyps was also significantly increased
      (114vs52, p\textless0.001).

      CONCLUSIONS: In a low prevalent ADR population, an automatic polyp detection
      system during colonoscopy resulted in a significant increase in the number of
      diminutive adenomas detected, as well as an increase in the rate of hyperplastic
      polyps. The cost-benefit ratio of such effects has to be determined further.

      variation in colonoscopy quality. Computer-aided detection (CADe) has improved
      adenoma detection rate (ADR) and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) in randomized
      controlled trials. There is a need to assess the impact of CADe in real-world
      settings.

      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science for nonrandomized real-world
      studies of CADe in colonoscopy. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed
      to examine the effect of CADe on ADR and APC. The study is registered under
      PROSPERO (CRD42023424037). There was no funding for this study.

      RESULTS: Twelve of 1,314 studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, ADR was statistically
      significantly higher with vs without CADe (36.3% vs 35.8%, risk ratio [RR] 1.13,
      95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.28). This difference remained significant
      in subgroup analyses evaluating 6 prospective (37.3% vs 35.2%, RR 1.15, 95%
      CI 1.01-1.32) but not 6 retrospective (35.7% vs 36.2%, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92-1.36)

      was 1.12 (95% CI 0.95-1.33). In 4 studies with GI Genius (Medtronic), there
      was no difference in ADR with vs without CADe (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.07).

      DISCUSSION: ADR, but not APC, was slightly higher with vs without CADe among
      all available real-world studies. This difference was attributed to the results
      of prospective but not retrospective studies. The discrepancies between these

      \ and P\_= .01, respectively). The adenoma detection rate (ADR), adenomas per\
      \ index colonoscopy, and adenomas per positive index colonoscopy (APPC) were\
      \ independently associated with AMR (P\_= .02, P\_= .01, and P\_= .008, respectively),\
      \ whereas APPC was the only factor independently associated with AAMR (P\_=\
      \ .006). An APPC value greater than 1.8 was more effective in monitoring AMR\
      \ (31% vs 15% for AMR P \\textless .0001) than an ADR value of at least 34%\
      \ (27% vs 17% for AMR; P\_= .008). The AAMR of colonoscopies with an APPC value\
      \ below 1.7 was 35%, vs 2% for colonoscopies with an APPC value of at least\
      \ 1.7 (P\_= .0005).\nConclusions\nIn a systematic review and meta-analysis,\
      \ we found that adenomas and advanced adenomas are missed (based on AMR and\
      \ AAMR) more frequently than previously believed. In addition to ADR, APPC deserves\
      \ consideration as a complementary indicator of colonoscopy quality, if it is\
      \ validated in additional studies."

    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Multiple randomized studies have demonstrated that computer-assisted
      detection (CADe) improves the colonoscopic adenoma detection rate (ADR); however,
      these improvements have not been consistently reproduced in some more recent
      studies.

      METHODS: Patients aged 50 years and older undergoing outpatient colonoscopy
      in 12 German institutions were randomized to either the CADe group or the control
      group. The primary outcome parameter was the ADR, while secondary outcomes included
      the adenomas per colonoscopy rate, detection rates of different histologic subgroups,
      and adverse events. The median examiner-specific observed rates and examiner-adjusted
      rates were compared between treatment groups.

      RESULTS: One thousand six hundred twenty-seven patients were included (mean
      age 63.1 years, 39.8% female; 71% screening indications). The observed median
      examiner ADR was 40.0% (interquartile range 20.0%-57.1%) in the study vs 37.5%
      (inter-quartile range 20.0%-50.0%) in the control group. Similarly, adjusted
      overall ADR was 40.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35.8%, 45.5%) in the study
      and 38.3% (95% CI: 33.5%, 43.1%) in the control group. No differences were observed
      in adenomas per colonoscopy or any of the adenoma subgroups with regard to size,
      morphology, location, and histology as well as colonoscopy indication. The examiner
      had a large influence on ADR (adjusted median odds ratio [OR] 1.32), similar
      to patient age (OR per 10-year increase 1.40, 95% CI: 1.23-1.59) and sex (OR
      1.62, 95% CI: 1.30-2.04). On the other hand, more hyperplastic polyps were found
      by CADe (OR for adjusted hyperplastic polyp detection rate = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.02-1.63;
      P = 0.033).

      DISCUSSION: In patients older than 50 years with mixed colonoscopy indications,
      CADe did not increase the ADR. Further studies should define the requirements
      for selective CADe use in routine clinical practice, particularly in relation
      to the examiner''s baseline ADR.'
