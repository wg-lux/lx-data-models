  description: Cold snare polypectomy is a technique used to remove small polyps
    from the colon. It is performed using a snare wire loop that is passed through
    the colonoscope and used to remove the polyp by cutting it off at the base.
    The procedure is usually done without the need for sedation and is considered
    to be a safe and effective way to remove small polyps from the colon.

  name: endoscopy_biopsy_foreceps_resection_generic
  description: Biopsy is a technique used to take a small sample of tissue from
    a lesion in the colon. It is performed by inserting a small instrument through
    the colonoscope and removing a small piece of tissue from the lesion. The tissue
    sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis to determine if the lesion
    is cancerous or benign.

  name: endoscopy_emr_generic
  description: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a technique used to remove
    large polyps or early-stage cancers from the colon. It is performed by injecting
    a solution under the lesion to create a cushion of fluid that lifts the lesion
    away from the colon wall. A snare wire loop is then used to remove the lesion
    by cutting it off at the base. The procedure is usually done under sedation
    and is considered to be a safe and effective way to remove large polyps or early-stage
    cancers from the colon.
