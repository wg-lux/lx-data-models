  name: endoscopy_ablation_argon_plasma_coagulation
  description: Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a non-contact thermal ablation
    technique used to treat various lesions in the colon. It involves the use of ionized
    argon gas to deliver electrical energy to the target tissue, causing coagulation and
    devitalization of the lesion. APC is commonly used for the treatment of bleeding
    lesions, such as angiodysplasia, as well as for the ablation of residual adenomatous
    tissue following polypectomy.
