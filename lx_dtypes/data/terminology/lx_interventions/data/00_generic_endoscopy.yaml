  name: endoscopy_injection_liftup
  description: Lift-up injection is a technique used to lift up a lesion in the
    colon. It is performed by injecting a solution under the lesion to create a
    cushion of fluid that lifts the lesion away from the colon wall. This allows
    the lesion to be removed more easily and reduces the risk of complications during
    the procedure.
